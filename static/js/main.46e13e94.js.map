It's common to want to do these at the same time - the first time we want to submit performance data for any individual, for instance. It's convenient to be able to do both, so let's try that with ACI performance data.</p>\n          <p>Here's a <code>POST</code> request to create a submission.

This indicates that the syntax of the request was correct, but the semantics were problematic. The response body includes more specific information: <code>DuplicateEntryError</code>. We've tried to create a duplicate submission - earlier we noted that each taxpayer/provider ID combination can have one submission per year. The <code>POST</code> API request we just sent uses the same identifiers as we did in our first tutorial, but CMS already has a submission on record for this individual.</p>\n          <p>There are a variety of reasons why this collision might happen: it's plausible that we (or someone else) has tried to <code>POST</code> this individual's performance data before, or someone made a typo and used our TIN by accident. Either way, we asked the API to <em>create</em> a record where one already exists. Since the API (and CMS) can't assume what the correct course of action is to take for this problematic API request, the messaging in the response is handy for immediately showing us something went wrong, and what specifically.</p>\n          <p>If we wanted to <em>update</em> the existing submission we could use a <code>PUT</code> (full record update) or <code>PATCH</code> (partial record update) request, but since we're trying to show how we can create a new submission with measurement data embedded, let's use a different TIN and try again.</p>\n          <InlineApiExample\n            verb=\"POST\"\n            url=\"/v1/submissions\"\n            params={\n              <tbody>\n                <tr><td>Program Name</td>\n                    <td>MIPS</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Entity</td>\n                    <td>Individual</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Taxpayer Identification Number</td>\n                    <td>000345678</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>National Provider Identifier</td>\n                    <td>9876543210</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Performance Year</td>\n                    <td>2016</td></tr>\n                <tr><td className=\"nested-once\">Measurement Set</td></tr>\n                <tr><td className=\"nested-twice\">Measure <code>ACI_INFBLO_1</code></td>\n                    <td><code>true</code></td></tr>\n                <tr><td className=\"nested-twice\">Measure <code>ACI_ONCDIR_1</code></td>\n                    <td><code>true</code></td></tr>\n                <tr><td className=\"nested-twice\">Measure <code>ACI_EP_1</code></td>\n                    <td>100 out of 100</td></tr>\n                <tr><td className=\"nested-twice\">Measure <code>ACI_PPHI_1</code></td>\n                    <td><code>true</code></td></tr>\n                <tr><td className=\"nested-twice\">Measure <code>ACI_PEA_1</code></td>\n                    <td>50 out of 100</td></tr>\n                <tr><td className=\"nested-twice\">Measure <code>ACI_HIE_1</code></td>\n                    <td>10 out of 100</td></tr>\n                <tr><td className=\"nested-twice\">Measure <code>ACI_HIE_2</code></td>\n                    <td>20 out of 100</td></tr>\n              </tbody>\n            }\n            button={\n              <button\n                className=\"ds-c-button ds-c-button--primary\"\n                data-hash=\"#submitting-with-performance-data-pt2\"\n                onClick={this.showResponseOfStep}>\n                Create Submission\n              </button>\n            }/>\n          <p>A <code>201 Created</code> - great.

The additional visibility helps because sometimes a submission can be valid, but incomplete for scoring purposes.</p>\n         <p>The scoring is more complicated for ACI measures, so we'll spend more time going through that.</p>\n          <InlineApiExample\n            verb=\"GET\"\n            url=\"/v1/submissions/:id/score\"\n            button={\n              <button\n                className=\"ds-c-button ds-c-button--primary\"\n                data-hash=\"#aci-scoring\"\n                onClick={this.showResponseOfStep}>\n                Get Submission Score\n              </button>\n            }/>\n          <p>The ACI component of our score shows many parts this time. There's a lot of numbers here, but let's decode how we arrive at the total:</p>\n          <p>The <code>aci_base</code> starts at 50 because we've attested to the two required measures (<code>ACI_INFBLO_1</code>, <code>ACI_ONCDIR_1</code>).</p>\n          <p>Three optional measures listed (<code>ACI_PEA_1</code>, <code>ACI_HIE_1</code>, <code>ACI_HIE_2</code>) give a possible 10 points each, multiplied by the proportion attested to, leading to partial contributions of 5, 2, and 1 points respectively.</p>\n          <p>Two measures we included have 0 weighting (<code>ACI_EP_1</code>, <code>ACI_PPHI_1</code>), so they are excluded from scoring.</p>\n          <p>We didn't attest to any measures that qualify for ACI or CEHRT bonuses, so those parts do not contribute to our score. These five measures give us our base ACI score of 58. With ACI contributing 25% of the total score as described in the response, our overall score is 14.5 (25% of 58).</p>\n          <p>As we can see, ACI scoring requires an understanding of what measures are required and how they're weighted. However, if we become familiar with these measures, scoring via the API immediately gives us a clear picture of our score and what parts contribute - this is a big advantage in making sure we get the score we understand and expect.</p>\n          <p>What if we're later in the year and can attest to a greater proportion for one of the measures? We can easily do that in the API as well!</p>\n          <button\n            className=\"ds-c-button ds-c-button--primary\"\n            data-hash=\"#updating-a-measure\"\n            onClick={this.showStartOfStep}>\n            Next step\n          </button>\n          <h2 id=\"updating-a-measure\">\n            <a\n              className=\"tutorial-header-link\"\n              href=\"#updating-a-measure\"\n              onClick={this.showStartOfStep}>\n              Updating a measure\n            </a>\n          </h2>\n          <p>So far we've only been creating new submission and measurement set records. Since performance data can change over time, we'll need to update CMS. Let's update an existing measure with new performance data! In addition to a measurement <code>ID</code>, we need to provide the measurement set <code>ID</code> and the measure <code>ID</code>. For the performance data itself, let's update the <code>ACI_HIE_1</code> proportion from 10 out of 100 to 50 out of 100 and see how that affects our score.</p>\n          <InlineApiExample\n            verb=\"PATCH\"\n            url=\"/v1/measurements/:id\"\n            params={\n              <tbody>\n                <tr><td>Measurement ID</td>\n                    <td>a3cb7c78-2380-4573-b726-8c8e3b70529a</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Measurement Set ID</td>\n                    <td>b702d4ee-5a75-4e10-9aaf-3539123956e7</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Measure ID</td>\n                    <td><code>ACI_HIE_1</code></td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Proportion</td>\n                    <td>50 out of 100</td></tr>\n              </tbody>\n            }\n            button={\n              <button\n                className=\"ds-c-button ds-c-button--primary\"\n                data-hash=\"#updating-a-measure\"\n                onClick={this.showResponseOfStep}>\n                Update Measurement\n              </button>\n            }/>\n          <p>A <code>200 OK</code> means we've updated the measurement in question.

We know this change is due to our PATCH by looking at the score component contributed by <code>ACI_HIE_1</code> - it increased from 1 to 5, since the proportion increased from 10 to 50 out of 100 with ten possible points from this measure. The ACI base score went up from 58 to 62, and with the ACI component being 25% of the score our final score increased by 1.</p>\n          <p>It's important to note that we've been working in one measurement set for this tutorial. One of the reasons that performance data for measures is organized into measurement sets is that multiple submission methods can add their own measurement sets into one submission - measure scores that might overlap the ones we provide, or differ in their attested values. In the case of multiple measurement sets, the Submissions API will calculate scores for each measurement set and pick the highest to present as the final score - that's why the API identifies that the scoring for the ACI component is based on a specific measurement set ID.</p>\n          <p>We've done a lot of work in 5 API requests! In this advanced tutorial, we created a submission with ACI performance attestations, scored it, and updated a piece of one measurement to see how the final score reacts. That means we've successfully used each API endpoint (submission, measurement set, measurement) and understood what the responses tell us, adjusting our approach as needed. Again, all of this work is done on our terms, at our pace - no months-long round trip required.</p>\n          <h3>Next steps</h3>\n          <p>While we've used each API endpoint, we're far from having used every kind of API action. These tutorials have used <code>POST</code>, <code>PATCH</code>, and <code>GET</code> - there are also <code>PUT</code> and <code>DELETE</code> for each of the three resources we worked with.</p>\n          <p>The tutorials have shown how requests can be strung together to complete complex workflows in minutes rather than months.

Performance data is organized into <em>submissions</em>, which can have many <em>measurements</em>. Measurements within a submission are also grouped by category (e.g. Improvement Activities) and submission method (e.g. CMS web interface) into <em>measurement sets</em>.</p>\n          <p>Since the API and scoring calculations are still being finalized, please note that some numbers (especially scoring) may be inaccurate. The <a href=\"https://qpp-submissions-sandbox.navapbc.com/api-explorer\">interactive API</a> will always reflect the latest design.</p>\n          <p>Let's walk through an example of how we might submit performance data!</p>\n          <h2 className=\"ds-h2\" id=\"creating-a-submission\">\n            <a\n              className=\"tutorial-header-link\"\n              href=\"#creating-a-submission\"\n              onClick={this.showStartOfStep}>\n                Creating a new submission\n            </a>\n          </h2>\n          <p>We need to create a <em>submission</em> first. We can do that by asking the API to create a submission record in the CMS database. In API terms, this means making a <code>POST</code> (synonym for <em>create</em>) request to the <code>/v1/submissions</code> endpoint. We'll also need to supply some information to tell CMS how to identify this particular submission, which you can see below - every submission is unique to the combination of the fields provided.</p>\n          <p>Note that we enforce fake TINs (starting with <code>000</code>) during the preview period to avoid accidentally collecting personally identifiable information. Also, we can submit performance data in this first request as well, but we'll do it in a future request to keep this one small. On the right side, you can see the <code>JSON</code> version of the information below - click the 'Create Submission' button when you're ready.</p>\n          <InlineApiExample\n            verb=\"POST\"\n            url=\"/v1/submissions\"\n            params={\n              <tbody>\n                <tr><td>Program Name</td>\n                    <td>MIPS</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Entity</td>\n                    <td>Individual</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Taxpayer Identification Number</td>\n                    <td>000456789</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>National Provider Identifier</td>\n                    <td>9876543210</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Performance Year</td>\n                    <td>2017</td></tr>\n              </tbody>\n            }\n            button={\n              <button\n                className=\"ds-c-button ds-c-button--primary\"\n                data-hash=\"#creating-a-submission\"\n                onClick={this.showResponseOfStep}>\n                Create Submission\n              </button>\n            }/>\n          <p>Every API request gives us back an immediate response with useful information, which we can see to the right. Much like a good conversation, this response includes a restatement of what we said, plus additional input from CMS's understanding to make sure we're both on the same page.</p>\n          <p>This response has two key pieces of information - the <em>response code</em>, which is a number that indicates success (<code>200</code> to <code>299</code>) or failure (<code>400</code> to <code>499</code>). The other piece is the <em>response body</em>, which contains <code>JSON</code> or <code>XML</code> describing in more detail the record stored with CMS.</p>\n          <p>We know that the <code>POST</code> request succeeded from the response code (<code>201 Created</code>). CMS also gives us an <code>id</code> that tells how to refer to this submission later, some timestamps to let us know when this submission was created and last updated, and that there are no measurement sets for this submission yet (an empty list, represented by <code>[]</code>).</p>\n          <p>If you're interested in comparing the API requests and responses, you can click between the tabs on the right side at any time.</p>\n          <p>Anyway, CMS can't do much without our performance numbers. Let's add some!</p>\n          <button\n            className=\"ds-c-button ds-c-button--primary\"\n            data-hash=\"#adding-measurements\"\n            onClick={this.showStartOfStep}>\n            Next step\n          </button>\n          <h2 className=\"ds-h2\" id=\"adding-measurements\">\n            <a\n              className=\"tutorial-header-link\"\n              href=\"#adding-measurements\"\n              onClick={this.showStartOfStep}>\n              Adding measurements\n            </a>\n          </h2>\n          <p>In our example, we have performance data for one measure that we want to send to CMS. Much like creating the submission, we need to create a measurement by making a <code>POST</code> request. This time it'll be addressed to a different endpoint, and we'll include the submission <code>id</code> from earlier so CMS knows which submission we're talking about.</p>\n          <p>Remember that measurements are grouped into measurement sets? The data in our <code>POST</code> request will be organized this way, with the measurement nested inside the data for a measurement set - you can see what that looks like on the right. Our example includes a boolean (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) value for measure <code>IA_EPA_4</code>.</p>\n          <p>If we want to add measurements from different categories (Advancing Care Information vs our Improvement Activity) or submission methods (not the CMS web interface), we would need to do that in another measurement set. Measurement sets become more important during scoring, since there can be performance data concerning the same care but submitted by different people - we'll dig into that in our advanced tutorial. For now, let's ask the API to add our IA measurement:</p>\n          <InlineApiExample\n            verb=\"POST\"\n            url=\"/v1/measurement-sets\"\n            params={\n              <tbody>\n                <tr><td>Submission ID</td>\n                    <td>b6423273-d3a3-42ef-9728-1871b246477e</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Category</td>\n                    <td>IA</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Submission Method</td>\n                    <td>CMS Web Interface</td></tr>\n                <tr><td>Performance period</td>\n                    <td>2016-01-01 through 2016-06-01</td></tr>\n                <tr><td className=\"nested-once\">Measurements</td></tr>\n                <tr><td className=\"nested-twice\"><code>IA_EPA_4</code></td>\n                    <td><code>true</code></td></tr>\n              </tbody>\n            }\n            button={\n              <button\n                className=\"ds-c-button ds-c-button--primary\"\n                data-hash=\"#adding-measurements\"\n                onClick={this.showResponseOfStep}>\n                Create Measurement Set\n              </button>}/>\n          <p>Another <code>201 Created</code>, and we can see that this time the measurement set and measurement have both been assigned <code>id</code>s. Nothing too surprising in this step, but we've given CMS everything necessary to score this submission.</p>\n          <button\n            className=\"ds-c-button ds-c-button--primary\"\n            data-hash=\"#scoring-a-submission\"\n            onClick={this.showStartOfStep}>\n            Next step\n          </button>\n          <h2 className=\"ds-h2\" id=\"scoring-a-submission\">\n            <a\n              className=\"tutorial-header-link\"\n              href=\"#scoring-a-submission\"\n              onClick={this.showStartOfStep}>\n              Scoring a submission\n            </a>\n          </h2>\n          <p>With the submission <code>id</code> we were given, we can ask the API to calculate the submission score with a GET request. We don't need to include a request body this time since we're only interested in retrieving the score, and CMS doesn't need any information other than the submission <code>id</code>.</p>\n          <InlineApiExample\n            verb=\"GET\"\n            url=\"/v1/submissions/:id/score\"\n            button={\n              <button\n                className=\"ds-c-button ds-c-button--primary\"\n                data-hash=\"#scoring-a-submission\"\n                onClick={this.showResponseOfStep}>\n                Get Submission Score\n              </button>}/>\n          <p>Our API response includes a bunch of new info this time, so let's break it down.</p>\n          <p>The <code>Final Score</code> has a value of <code>3.75</code>. <code>Final</code> here doesn't mean it's the final end of year score for this submission - think of this instead as the <em>current aggregate estimate</em> of your total score.</p>\n          <p>If you look at the first chunk of <code>JSON</code> in the <code>\"parts\"</code> list, the IA component of final score reads <code>3.75</code>. The <code>\"detail\"</code> makes clear that the scoring is based on the measurement set we submitted earlier (check the <code>id</code>s, they match!).</p>\n          <p>The second chunk in <code>\"parts\"</code> is straightforward - we did not submit any ACI data, so our aggregate score has no contribution from ACI measures.</p>\n          <p>That's it! We've used three API requests to (1) create a submission, (2) add measurements into a measurement set, and (3) get the score, all in minutes. Each API response gives us useful information for the next step.</p>\n          <p>In general, we can think about the Submissions API as a way to have a live conversation with CMS about performance measurements. Rather than waiting months to hear back about missing information or a score, the API gives us feedback that is immediate, specific, and actionable - we can easily make another API request if necessary.</p>\n          <p>What we've shown is an example of working directly with the API - typically these requests are made through a web interface or script, but the requests & responses above illustrate the kind of power and speed the Submissions API and applications built against it can provide.</p>\n          <h3>Next steps</h3>\n          <p>Explore a more complex and powerful workflow
